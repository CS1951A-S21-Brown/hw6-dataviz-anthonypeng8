        <h2>Written Questions:</h2>
        <h4>
            1. The first barplot answers the question on what the top 10 video games were all time. I decided to first rank them 
            by North American Sales as that is our current location, then added an option to view the rank of the video games 
            globally (global sales) for comparison. The top video games are at the top of graph with a longer bar to represent higher 
            sales. </br>
            The pieplot answers the question overall (by global sales) on which genre is most popular. Also, it addresses 
            the question of what are the top publishers for each genre. The pieplot in sorted order clock-wise represents the 
            proportion/percentage of sales from the total in that genre. Furthermore, hovering over the slices will pop up a card 
            telling what the top 3 publishers are for that genre. </br>
            The second barplot represents the genre sales broken down by region (NA, EU, JP, Other, Global). The barplot will rank 
            the genres by sales with the highest and widest bar at the top. I included buttons to change the barplot based on which 
            region to visualize for top genre. </br>
        </br>
        </br>
            2. D3 was very helpful in adding proper scaling for transitions of the barplots (different sale values will 
            correspond to lower/higher max values). D3 was helpful for giving a lot of flexibility, there were a lot options to 
            choose from the to address the questions, from barplots, scatterplots, maps, pieplots, histograms, etc.. D3 was helpful 
            in having plentiful customizations. It was relatively simple to change the positions, colors, or add new functions like 
            the tooltips with mouseover and mouseout functions. </br>
        </br>
        </br>
            3. D3 may have a lot a parts and customization tools, so if the visualization should be very simple and clean it may be 
            better to use other tools that are faster to implement. D3 although very diverse has a limited number of built in 
            functions, you may need to have your own unique/creative visualization to be represent your data. If your visualization 
            has a lot of movement it may be better to use other tools (I may be incorrect about this though). </br>
        </br>
        </br>
            4. I addressed the possiblity of colorblindness by not having color needed to correctly grasp the visualization. 
            For example, from “A Comprehensive Guide to Accessible Data Visualization,” I made sure to add seperations in the 
            slices of the piechart to ensure differences if the user cannot differentiate color.
            Users that might find it difficult to access the visualization would be visually impaired or unable to click on the 
            actions to see more/change the visualization. For example, I have buttons for the user needs to click to see other 
            parts of the visualization and hovering over the slices of the piechart to address the question of what are the top 
            publishers for each genre. Steps to help overcome this, would be add other sensors other than vision (sound, touch, etc.) 
            and to fully represent all the data without any action required to see them. </br>
        </br>
        </br>
            5. Stages of the development of the visualization I felt like I could of changed to help improve the accessiblity to all 
            users would be changing the idea of condensing multiple parts of visualizations into 1 graph. For example, I could of 
            created a seperate graph to represent the top publishers for each genre, but I decided to add that to tooltip hoverings on 
            top of the piechart for 'efficiency'. Also, it may have been better to in some way represent all the genres broken down to 
            all the regions in 1 collected graph (with no action/buttons required). Overall I was more concerned with efficiency/
            compactness and visually appealing transitions/changes to the visualization which kept me from going through with those 
            ideas.
